        </div>
        <div class="project-description">
            <p>After a successful launch in Brazil, Mexican Corporate Expense Management fintech Clara aimed to expand operations and build a payment product, later redirecting it as Clara’s first Digital Account. The product soon became the main bet of the company, in it’s most strategical market.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="project-description">
            <p>We started building Clara’s Digital Account as a bill-pay product, utilizing the company’s credit line as a payment method for Brazilian-specific bill format: the Boleto. However, because of challenges in regulations and the need for Clara to have a banking partner to process the payment, the bill-pay product was pivoted into the digital account - now we would not only make payments, we would guide users through Boleto payments, B2B and B2C transfers, collect charges by issuing a Boleto, and later on even make Pix transactions.</p>

        <div class="project-description">
            <p>Clara needed a Payment product in Brazil to expand user perception and engagement with the company beyond Corporate credit cards. </p>
            <p>A digital account would check all the boxes:</p>
            <p>• Influx of capital from the users deposits;</p>
            <p>• Closed-ecosystem catering to the user’s needs (i.e; paying Clara Card with the Clara Account funds);</p>
            <p>• Position Clara as a bigger player in a very sophisticated market (Brazilian digital accounts, payment products and other fintechs);</p>

        <div class="project-description">
            <p>The first step on the discovery process was to understand the digital account customer, that had different needs and pain points from both the Mexican bill-pay users and the Brazilian corporate cards user. Also, it was important to educate Clara’s stakeholders on the omnipresence and symbolic importance of the Boleto as an payment instrument in Brazil.</p>

        <div class="project-description">
            <p>To meet the expectations of stakeholders about the discovery process of the digital account, it was made an extensive research process focused on understanding priorities, deal-breakers and ultimately guide our product according to what our users needed, instead of what we wanted them to adopt.</p>
            <p>• Multiple personas and ideal users: the digital account can be used by financing analysts, accountants, CFOs and CEOs - depending of the size of the company the degree of their stablished payment processes.</p>
            <p>• The Brazilian market is used to high-level banking solutions and has a wide array of choices outside Clara.</p>
            <p>• Users excited about translating the Clara Card experience to payments.</p>
            <p>• Users excited about paying Clara Card using their own funds already in Clara’s digital account.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="project-description">
            <p>We knew our V1 product would be scaled down and bare-boned, so we prioritized building solid basics instead of more sophisticated product features. One of our main discoveries was that we could not compete with big banks and their relationship with our customers, so we aimed to be one of the products in their stack of expenses management workflow. </p>

        <div class="project-description">
            <p>After presenting our insights to stakeholders, we worked with product defining the product strategy.</p>
            <p>• We have to communicate with the business owner that doesn’t have an ERP solution yet. This ended up being key to guiding product to pursue more start-up instead of enterprise clients.</p>
            <p>• They need a digital account because not every company expense is on a credit-card, such as paying tolls, buying props for photoshoots and buying water from street vendors.</p>
            <p>• When surveyed, our clients responded they would prefer to pay a monthly fee for a bundle of services instead of per-transaction. We then proposed a fremium pricing strategy.</p>
