        <div class="project-description">
            <p>Clara wished to replicate in Brazil their already successful payments solution in Mexico, but due to differences in banking scenarios, a digital account in Brazil posed specific challenges and aimed to cater to a target audience already used to a higher standard in banking experience and leading digital accounts such as Nubank and most big banks.</p>

            <p>I led the design, user testing and documentation of this project from end to end.

            <p>The first step on the discovery process was to understand the digital account customer, that had different needs and pain points from both the Mexican bill-pay users and the Brazilian corporate cards user. Also, it was important to educate Clara’s stakeholders on the omnipresence and symbolic importance of the Boleto as an payment instrument in Brazil.</p>

            <p>To meet the expectations of stakeholders about the discovery process of the digital account, it was made an extensive research process focused on understanding priorities, deal-breakers and ultimately guide our product according to what our users needed, instead of what we wanted them to adopt.</p>
            <p>• Multiple personas and ideal users: the digital account can be used by financing analysts, accountants, CFOs and CEOs - depending of the size of the company the degree of their stablished payment processes.</p>
            <p>• The Brazilian market is used to high-level banking solutions and has a wide array of choices outside Clara.</p>

            <p>We knew our V1 product would be scaled down and bare-boned, so we prioritized building solid basics instead of more sophisticated product features. One of our main discoveries was that we could not compete with big banks and their relationship with our customers, so we aimed to be one of the products in their stack of expenses management workflow. </p>

            <p>After presenting our insights to stakeholders, we worked with product defining the product strategy.</p>
            <p>• We have to communicate with the business owner that doesn’t have an ERP solution yet. This ended up being key to guiding product to pursue more start-up instead of enterprise clients.</p>
            <p>• They need a digital account because not every company expense is on a credit-card, such as paying tolls, buying props for photoshoots and buying water from street vendors.</p>
            <p>• When surveyed, our clients responded they would prefer to pay a monthly fee for a bundle of services instead of per-transaction. We then proposed a fremium pricing strategy.</p>
