            <p>Clara wished to replicate in Brazil their already successful payments solution in Mexico, but due to differences in banking scenarios, a digital account in Brazil posed specific challenges and aimed to cater to a target audience already used to a higher standard in banking experience and leading digital accounts such as Nubank and most big banks.</p>

            <p>We knew our V1 product would be scaled down and bare-boned, so we prioritized building solid basics instead of more sophisticated product features.

            <p>After presenting our insights to stakeholders, we worked with product defining the product strategy.</p>
            <p>• We have to communicate with the business owner that doesn’t have an ERP solution yet. This ended up being key to guiding product to pursue more start-up instead of enterprise clients.</p>
            <p>• They need a digital account because not every company expense is on a credit-card, such as paying tolls, buying props for photoshoots and buying water from street vendors.</p>
            <p>• When surveyed, our clients responded they would prefer to pay a monthly fee for a bundle of services instead of per-transaction. We then proposed a fremium pricing strategy.</p>

            <p>• My biggest contribution to Clara Conta was getting stakeholder buy-in for a security checkpoint.</p>
            <p>• Because of differences between countries culture and banking scenario, the payment product in Mexico did not use a password confirmation before validating an operation.</p>
            <p>• Surprisingly, ensuring Clara Conta would have a security layer (a pin, a one-time password, a 2FA code, anything) was my biggest fight and having this feature approved was my biggest achievement within the project.</p>
            <p>• My designs for 2FA inputs and OTP code validation were included on the company’s design system, since there wasn’t a security checkpoint for operations before the digital account. Ultimately, the team went with a pop-up solution that required a screen on its own.</p>
